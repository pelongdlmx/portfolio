## 🚀 Professional Portfolio: Diego Solorzano

This is my digital portfolio, built using **React 18**, summarizing my career as a **Senior Front-end Software Engineer** (8+ years).

The project is designed to reflect my expertise in:

-   **Global Impact:** Key projects, including leading the #1 industry website.
-   **Innovation:** Integration and development of Artificial Intelligence solutions (Python/Mistral-7B).

A standout feature is the **real-time PDF CV download** functionality, generated directly from the project's JSON data.
